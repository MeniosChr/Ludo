Overview:
Ludo is a strategy board game for four players, in which the players race their 
four pawns from start to finish according to the rolls of a dice.
At the beginning of the game, each player's four pawns are out of play and 
staged in the player's base (one of the large corner areas of the board in the player's colour)
the game takes turn and the first to bring all their pawns to the center wins the game.

-You have to roll 5 to move the pawn from the base to the first button of its 
 route,by clicking on the pawn. Unfortunately you can't play this roll, 
 but you can roll again.

-You can have multiple pawns on the table and move the one of your choisee, by clicking
 the button that fit's with your dice and the pawn's movement.

 pawn move ends on an opponent's pawn, then good job the opponent's pawn send 
 back to it's base.

-You can have two or more of your pawns on the same button of the table.
